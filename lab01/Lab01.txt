   Kernel32.dll			
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   CloseHandle - 			
   CopyFileA   - Makes a copy of a file.	
   CreateFileA - Creates or opens an existing file
   CreateFileMappingA - Creates a handle to a file mapping that loads a file 
			into memory and makes it accessible via memory address.
   FindClose  
   FindFirstFileA - Used to search through a directory and enumerate a filesystem.
   IsBadReadPtr - Verifies that the calling process has read access to a range of mem.
   MapViewOfFile - Maps a file into memory and makes the contents of the file 
		   accessible via memory address. By using this, malware can avoid
		   using WriteFile to modify contents of a file.	

   Guess: From these imports, I am guessing that this piece of malware is either a 
	  launcher, or an injector. It can be seen through the imports, that this 
      	  code opens and creates files, as well as uses mappings to modify files that
 	  already exist. Using MapViewOfFile, it looks as if it is trying to hide the
   	  modification of the file its writing to.

   CloseHandle			
   CreateMutex
   CreateProcess
   OpenMutex
   Sleep

   Libraries to note: 

   CreateMutex - Creates a mutual exclusion object that can be used by malware to 
		 ensure that only a single instance of malware is running on a system
		 at any given time. Malware often uses fixed names for mutexes which
		 can be good host-based indicators to detect additional installations
		 of malware.
   CreateProcess
   OpenMutex   - Opens a handle to a Mutex object that can ensure only a single instance
		 of malware is running on a system at any given time.
   Sleep       - Specifies the amount of time for which execution is to be suspended.

   Guess: From what I can see, this piece of malware will try to suspend execution of
	  all processes on a machine by opening a Mutex and calling Sleep. In addition
	  the WS2_32.dll file imports networking functions by ordinal to mask their
	  names. It can be seen from these functions that the malware is connecting
          to some port and sending data to it.

   OpenMutex
   WaitForSingleObject
   CreateMutex
   CreateThread 
   OpenSCManager  - Opens a handle to the service contorl manager. Any program that
 		    installs, modifies, or controls a service must call this fn
	  	    before any other service manipulation
   StartServiceCtrlDispatcher - Used by a service to connect to the main thread of the
				process to the service control manager. Any process that
				runs as a service must call this function within 30
				seconds of startup. Locating this function in malware
				tells you that the function should run as a service.
   InternetOpen
   InternetOpenURL 	      - Opens a specific URL using FTP, HTTP, or HTTPS.

   Guess: This piece of malware starts a service that downloads things from the internet
	  (Downloader?)

   VariantInit    - Initializes a variant
   CoCreateInstance - Creates a single uninitalized object with a specified CLSID

   Guess: This piece of malware creates COM objects and allocates strings (?)

   Libaries of note:

   CreateFile         - Creates a file
   CreateRemoteThread - Creates and launches a new process. Launches and stealthware
		        use this to inject code into a different process.
   FindResource	      - Used to find a resource in an executable or loaded DLL. Malware
			sometimes uses resources to store strings, configuration info.
 			or other malicious files.
   GetModuleHandle    - Used to obtain a handle to an already loaded module. Malware may
			use this to locate and modify code in a loaded module or to 
			search for a good location to inject code
   GetProcAddress     -	Used to get the address of a function in another dll
   GetTempPath	      - Returns the temporary file path.
   GetWindowsDirectory- Returns the file path to the Windows directory. Malware 
			sometimes calls this to determine where to install additional
			malicious files
   LoadResource       - Loads a resource from a PE file into memory.
   MoveFile	      - Moves a file
   OpenProcess	      - Opens a handle to another process running on the system. 
			This handle can be used to read and write to the other process
			memory or to inject code into otger process.
   WinExe	      - Used to execute another program. 
   AdjustTokenPriviledges - Used to enable or disable specific access priveledges. 
 
   Guess: A lot of these imported modules have to do with code injection. So my guess
	  is that this piece of malware does something like that. It can also be seen
	  that this piece of malware calls priviledge functions, and also WinExe which
	  allows for program execution. Additionally, it looks like it loads functions
	  to look at the Windows directory, and the temp directory, and the creation
	  of files. Overall, there is a lot going on and it is hard to say what it does. 
************************************************************************************* 

OOPS - I was only suppsoed to look at Lab01-01.exe and Lab01-01.dll!!!!

5. Lab01-01.exe: Since the malware looks to be making copies of files, without a rename
  		 looking function, a host based indicator could be the same file found
  		 throughout the system.
   Lab01-01.dll: This file appears to use Mutex's to suspend execution of files. Since
		 mutex names are generally constant, the name of the mutex could be
		 searched for which would indicate an infected host.
   Lab01-02.exe: If the mutuxes in this piece of malware are constant, the mutex name 
		 can be searched for to identify an infected host.
   Lab01-03.exe: Assuming that the objects created uinsg VariantInit are using constant
		 names, infected hosts could pontentially be indentified by this.
   Lab01-04.exe: This piece of malware has a few host-based signatures. First, we can
		 see that files are being created. This filename might be constant,
		 indicating and infection. Also, this program has a WinExe function, 
		 that presumably could execute the same program. An uncommon program
		 being executed could indicate an infection. This program also launches
	  	 threads and get process addresses. If these are repeated and constant,
		 these can yet again be host based identifiers. This shouldn't have
		 any network identifiers since it doesn't access the web.

6. Lab01-01.exe  None - no networking functionality.
   Lab01-01.dll  Upon inspection, it can be seen that the malware is using socket fns
		 to connect to a port at some internet address. This is clearly a 
		 network based indicator, and given the likelyhood of this inet addr and
		 port being constant values in the malware, this can be searched for
		 to identify infected hosts.
   Lab01-02.exe  Since this piece of malware connects to the internet, and the hostname
		 of the connections is probably constant. Hosts connecting to a specific
		 URL can most likely be identified as infected.


7. Lab01-01.exe - Guess Purpose: My guess is that this malware modifies the contents of
				 specific files without the users knowledge. Why? That
				 is clearly unknown, but it doesn't look as if there is
				 any stealing of information, or installation of other
			 	 malware through it's library calls.
  
   Lab01-01.dll - Guess Purpose: My guess is that this piece of malware is designed to
				 steal information. Networking libraries are imported
				 and the computer being used has it's processes 
				 suspended by the Sleep function call.

8. (Lab01-04.exe only)
   The resource was identified as binary by ResourceHacker. Since the line "!This 
   program cannot be run in DOS" we can identify this resource actually as another 
   executable file. To view the file, Action -> Save resource as binary, and then
   open the binary file in dependecy walker to view the imports. Now we see 
   "URLDownloadFile" which explains the URL in the resource. 

   REMEMBER TO USE STRINGS!
