4. Lab01-01.exe:
   
   Kernel32.dll			
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   CloseHandle - 			
   CopyFileA   - Makes a copy of a file.	
   CreateFileA - Creates or opens an existing file
   CreateFileMappingA - Creates a handle to a file mapping that loads a file 
			into memory and makes it accessible via memory address.
   FindClose  
   FindFirstFileA - Used to search through a directory and enumerate a filesystem.
   IsBadReadPtr - 
   MapViewOfFile - Maps a file into memory and makes the contents of the file 
		   accessible via memory address. By using this, malware can avoid
		   using WriteFile to modify contents of a file.	

   Guess: From these imports, I am guessing that this piece of malware is either a 
	  launcher, or an injector. It can be seen through the imports, that this 
      	  code opens and creates files, as well as uses mappings to modify files that
 	  already exist. Using MapViewOfFile, it looks as if it is trying to hide the
   	  modification of the file its writing to.

   LoadLibrary			CreateService		InternetOpen	
   GetProcAddress
   VirtualProtect
   VirtualAlloc
   VirtualFree
   ExitProcess
   
   Libraries of Note:
 
   LoadLibrary    - Loads a DLL into a process that wasn't originally loaded into the
 		    Program at runtime
   GetProcAddress - Retrieves the address of a function in another DLL not loaded into
		    the program. 
   VirtualProtect - Changes the protection on a region of memory. Malware may use this
  		    to change a read-only section of memory to an executable
   VirtualAlloc   - Memory allocation that can allocate memory in a remote process
   InternetOpen   - Initializes high-level internet access functions

   Guess: According to sources, recursive imports are normal, as other dll files might 
	  need to import other dll functions. However, from the top level imports it 
	  is hard to say what this malware does (because it is packed probably). We
	  can see that this piece of malware creates a service, which will most likely
	  run in the background of the victim's computer. Secondly, we can see that
	  it is importing VirtualProtect, which changes the protection of a piece of
	  memory. This could be deadly as it could change permissions on a read-only
	  file or executable. Finally, we see that it imports the InternetOpen 
	  functions, which could be used for internet access. Overall, it is pretty
	  tough to see what this is doing, but we know that it most likely involves
	  creating a service, the internet, and changing permissions of files.

   Guess: Nothing. The malware is packed and give little to no indication of what is 
          going on here.

   Libaries of note:

   CreateFile         - Creates a file
   CreateRemoteThread - Creates and launches a new process. Launches and stealthware
		        use this to inject code into a different process.
   FindResource	      - Used to find a resource in an executable or loaded DLL. Malware
			sometimes uses resources to store strings, configuration info.
 			or other malicious files.
   GetModuleHandle    - Used to obtain a handle to an already loaded module. Malware may
			use this to locate and modify code in a loaded module or to 
			search for a good location to inject code
   GetProcAddress     -	Used to get the address of a function in another dll
   GetTempPath	      - Returns the temporary file path.
   GetWindowsDirectory- Returns the file path to the Windows directory. Malware 
			sometimes calls this to determine where to install additional
			malicious files
   LoadResource       - Loads a resource from a PE file into memory.
   MoveFile	      - Moves a file
   OpenProcess	      - Opens a handle to another process running on the system. 
			This handle can be used to read and write to the other process
			memory or to inject code into otger process.
   WinExe	      - Used to execute another program. 
   AdjustTokenPriviledges - Used to enable or disable specific access priveledges. 
 
   Guess: A lot of these imported modules have to do with code injection. So my guess
	  is that this piece of malware does something like that. It can also be seen
	  that this piece of malware calls priviledge functions, and also WinExe which
	  allows for program execution. Additionally, it looks like it loads functions
	  to look at the Windows directory, and the temp directory, and the creation
	  of files. Overall, there is a lot going on and it is hard to say what it does.
